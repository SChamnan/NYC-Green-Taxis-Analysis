# NYC-Green-Taxis-Analysis
**Team 07**: Chamnan Suon (project manager), Anna Baldzikowski, Allison Kramer, Akhil Nair, Mudongfang Li

## Overview

This project analyzes **NYC Green Taxi** trip data from **2019–2023** to uncover trends in ridership, revenue, tipping behavior, and geographic patterns across boroughs. It highlights the impact of **COVID-19** and translates findings into **actionable insights** for urban mobility and transportation planning.

## Objectives

* Analyze ridership and revenue trends over time
* Compare fares and tips across boroughs
* Identify high-performing locations
* Assess COVID-19’s impact on demand

## Data

* **Source:** NYC Open Data: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
* **Type:** Trip-level Green Taxi records
* **Key Fields:** pickup/drop-off time & location, trip distance, fare, tip, total amount

## Tools

* **SQL (Google BigQuery)** – data extraction, cleaning & aggregation
* **Tableau Desktop/Tableau Public** – visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – reproducible workflow

## Methodology

* Cleaned and validated trip records
* Aggregated metrics by year and borough using SQL
* Performed exploratory analysis and visualized trends
* Interpreted results with a business lens

## Key Insights

- Manhattan consistently leads in average tip amounts and revenue density, reflecting higher fare intensity and rider willingness to tip.
- COVID-19 caused a sharp demand contraction in 2020, with a steady but uneven recovery through 2023 across boroughs.
- Outer boroughs exhibit longer average trip distances but lower trip frequency, indicating different use cases and revenue dynamics than core urban areas.
- Revenue and demand are highly concentrated by location and time, suggesting opportunities for targeted operations and policy interventions.

## Business Value

This project demonstrates how trip-level transportation data can be transformed into **practical business and policy insights**. The findings can help:

* **Taxi drivers and operators** identify high-revenue locations and optimal operating periods
* **City officials and planners** evaluate post-COVID recovery patterns and adjust transportation policies
* **Transportation stakeholders** improve resource allocation by understanding demand concentration across boroughs

Overall, the analysis showcases the application of analytics to support **revenue optimization, operational efficiency, and data-driven urban mobility decisions**.

## Conclusion

This analysis shows that Green Taxi performance varies significantly by time and location, with Manhattan consistently generating higher tip values and overall revenue density. Despite the sharp decline during COVID-19, gradual recovery trends highlight opportunities for targeted operational strategies and policy-informed planning to improve efficiency and rider outcomes.
